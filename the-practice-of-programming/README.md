Lots of sound advice and philosophy on software development fundamentals.
Very c and c++ centric.
The collected rules in the back make the whole thing worth it.
There are interesting examples and challenges, but mostly done in C++ and c, so unless you are familiar with those languages, its a bit of a challenge to follow at times.
Thematically, its very similar to [The Go Programming Language](/gopl.md) book, and is generally a fantastic example of BWK's technical writing style; explaining very complex concepts in simple, understandable terms.
